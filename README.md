### 1. Predicting Employee Attrition using R

**Objective:** To predict employees likely to leave

**Description:** 
The project delves into an employee dataset from 2018, encompassing demographic details, job satisfaction indicators (such as workload, years of experience, salary level, etc.), job-specific information (including location, business travel), and other pertinent data. 
The project leverages supervised learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and Lasso regression, and evaluates their effectiveness by using the False Negative Rate. Emphasizing the false negative rate, the project prioritizes minimizing instances of incorrectly predicted negative outcomes.

In principle, the project follows this framework: <br>
Uncertainty: 	Employee exits or Employee stays <br>
Business Deployment: Target employees with employee benefits <br>
Goal: $E[Profit|X,D] = P(Employee stays | X,D) * V(X,D)$

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Predictive Modelling, Supervised Learning

**Technology:** R, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Lasso Regression
